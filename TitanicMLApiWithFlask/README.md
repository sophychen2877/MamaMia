this is a machinelearning prediction API with some frontend interaction created with flask.
datasets extraction -> not where I spent most of the effort at, so I used the old fashioned titanic datasets
data transformation -> filled out missing values, encode categorical data, and feature selection 
data loading -> save and import as csv
model building -> random forest, decision tree, logistic regression
model deployment -> pickle file 
api function -> select/save model, select/save model version, train model,display model, predict score
