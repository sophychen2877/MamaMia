# WCD-DS
DataScience Projects learned at WCD

Project 1 - learning KNN (K-nearest neighbors) using datasets from iris datasets in sklearn module.
NOT using numpy library (trying to understand the algorithms first) 
noted that the datasets is relatively small - only 150 rows (4columns each) and 70% for training, 30% for testing set
K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). Euclidean distance method is used for calculating the distance. 

Project 2 - Condos.ca Webscraping and DataAnalysis

Project 3 - Twitter Sentiment Analysis using given tweets.csv from CIBC tweets. using various model to calculate the sentiment score. positive/negative - borrow list of pos/neg words from this study: https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html
